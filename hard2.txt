Initialize Index i:
Start with the rightmost index i in the string s.

Find the Longest Palindrome Substring:
While i is greater than or equal to 0 and the substring from the beginning to index i is not a palindrome:
Decrement i to consider a shorter substring.

Construct and Return the Result:
Return the concatenation of the reversed substring starting from index i + 1 and the original string s.
