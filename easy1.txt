
Remove any trailing spaces at the end of the input string to ensure that the function starts counting the last word from the rightmost non-space character.

Initialize Length:
Initialize a variable to store the length of the last word.

Iterate through Characters in Reverse:
Iterate through the characters of the string in reverse order (from right to left).

Count Length of Last Word:
For each character, check if it is a space.
If a space is encountered, break out of the loop, as it indicates the end of the last word.
If a non-space character is encountered, increment the length variable.

Return the calculated length of the last word.
