Initialize Variables:
candidate1 and candidate2: Initialize two candidate elements.
count1 and count2: Initialize counters for the respective candidates.
result: Initialize an empty list to store the majority elements.

First Pass: Find Candidates:
Iterate through the array, updating candidates and their counters based on the majority voting algorithm.
If the current number is equal to either candidate, increment the respective counter.
If the counter for a candidate becomes zero, update the candidate to the current number.
If the counters for both candidates are non-zero, decrement both counters.

Second Pass: Count Occurrences:
Reset counters.
Iterate through the array, counting the occurrences of the two candidates.

Check and Append to Result:
If the count for a candidate is greater than ⌊ n/3 ⌋, append it to the result list.

Return the Result:
Return the list of majority elements.
