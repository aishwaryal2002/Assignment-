Initialize Variables:
count: Initialize a variable to store the total count of digit 1.
factor: Set a factor to 1 (used to calculate the contribution of each digit place).
i: Start with the ones place (1).

Iterate through Digit Places:
While i is less than or equal to n:
Calculate divider for the next digit place.
Update count based on the digit place using a formula that considers the range of numbers.
Multiply i by 10 to move to the next digit place.
Return the Result:

Return the total count of digit 1.
